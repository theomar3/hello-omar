ABOUT ME

I'm a coding newbie who is working his way around this strange new world of coding. I used to be an ESL teacher for 7 years until I decided to change my career due to a change of interest, job demand, and health issues. 

Right now I'm focusing on Web Development and I've just started coding bootcamp which will finish in October.
